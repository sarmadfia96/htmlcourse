	<p>I literally like the doing programming late night alone and sometimes watching movies when having yawns and feeling sleepy like 
		everyone does, but the normal behaviour of men that i have noticed is that men love to watch random movies for hours and not feeling sleepy but switching towards some sites that are for learning purpose and you start writing some few lines of code, you will feel lazy. 

		Then i concluded over the fact that it is all about intrest and priorities and the thoughts in the mind which dont let you focus on things.

		Don't waste your time motherfucker you have to do it for yourself no girl is important, they will ultimately marry the person of their&nbsp;parent's&nbsp;choice.
